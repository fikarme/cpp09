1.  `shuf -i 1-42 -n 31`
    *   `shuf`: The shuffle command. It randomizes lines of input.
    *   `-i 1-42`: This is the `--input-range` flag. It tells `shuf` to generate its own input: the numbers from 1 to 42.
    *   `-n 31`: This is the `--head-count` flag. It makes `shuf` output only the first 31 numbers from its randomized list.

2.  `| tr "\n" " "`
    *   `|`: The pipe. It sends the output from `shuf` (31 numbers, each on a new line) directly as input to the `tr` command.
    *   `tr "\n" " "`: The translate command. It finds every newline character (`\n`) and swaps it for a space (` `).
