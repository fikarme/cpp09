Aight, bet. Ditching `lower_bound` is a vibe. You can def get the same result with a different strat. Using `upper_bound` is a solid glow-up and just as efficient. It's basically the other side of the same coin.

### The `upper_bound` Method

Instead of finding the first element that's *not less than* your date, `upper_bound` finds the first element that's *greater than* your date. Once you have that, you just step back one position to land on the correct date. It's a clean and direct play.

Here's how you'd rewrite that logic block in `processLine`:

````cpp
// ...existing code...
	if (!isValidVal(valStr, val))
		return;

	map<string, float>::iterator it = _db.upper_bound(date);
	if (it == _db.begin()) {
		r("no data for or before this date.");
		return;
	}
	--it;

	cout << date << " => " << val << " = " << val * it->second << endl;
}

bool BitcoinExchange::isValidDate(const string &date) {
// ...existing code...
````

### The Breakdown

1.  **`map<string, float>::iterator it = _db.upper_bound(date);`**
    *   This finds the iterator to the first entry in the map whose date is strictly *greater than* the `date` you're looking for.
    *   If your `date` is `2011-01-05`, and the map has `2011-01-03` and `2011-01-09`, `it` will point to `2011-01-09`.

2.  **`if (it == _db.begin())`**
    *   This is the main edge case. If `upper_bound` gives you the very first element of the map, it means your target `date` is earlier than any date in the database. There's no previous date to fall back on, so you have to throw an error.

3.  **`--it;`**
    *   Since `it` points to the date *after* the one we want, we just decrement the iterator. This moves it back to the correct entry: the closest date that is less than or equal to the target `date`. It's a simple, clean move.

This approach is just as performant as `lower_bound` (O(log N) because `std::map` is a balanced binary search tree) and gets the job done with slightly different but equally valid logic. It's a solid alternative that keeps your code clean and compliant.
